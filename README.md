# Car-Price-Prediction


When I was learning what Numpy (Python's one infamous library) could do, then this specific car price prediction project helped me a lot to try and understand what command does what and how to get the result I am looking for by using the specific command. I tried every little things and even question myself what would be the output if I try this instead of this! 



'quikr_car.csv' is the file that I collected from kaggle.com and then I tried to clean the data as much as I can to get a final prediction of the price of the car.

I have also uploaded the final file which I saved as a excel file "Cleaned_Car_data" when all the data cleaning was done.
